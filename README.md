### Project Overview

An end-to-end data analytics project using Python and SQL. Processed and cleaned retail order data from Kaggle and pandas for data cleaning and transformation, loaded it into SQL Server for analysis. Utilized SQL queries to extract insights, such as identifying top-selling products, analyzing month-over-month sales growth, and determining the highest growth sub-category by profit. Demonstrated hands-on expertise in data processing and SQL-based analysis to answer business-critical questions.                                                                        
### Data Sources

Retail Orders Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "orders.csv" file, which contains detailed information about global mart sales data.

### Tools

- Python (Pandas) - Data Cleaning
- SQL Server - Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Extract the file from the zip file.
- Read data from the file and handle null values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.
- Load data into the SQL server.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
